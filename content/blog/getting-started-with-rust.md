## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that combines performance with safety and modern development features. This guide will help you get started with Rust development.

## Installation

First, let's install Rust using rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that Rust is properly installed:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Recommended Tools

1. **IDE/Editor**
   - VSCode with rust-analyzer
   - IntelliJ with Rust plugin
   - Sublime Text with Rust Enhanced

### Essential Extensions

For VSCode users, install these extensions:
- rust-analyzer
- CodeLLDB
- crates
- Better TOML

## Your First Rust Program

Create a new project:

```bash
cargo new hello_rust
cd hello_rust
```

Here's your first Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

### Running Your Program

Execute your program using:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Common Concepts

### Variables

```rust
let x = 5; // immutable by default
let mut y = 10; // mutable variable
```

### Functions

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Explore the Rust Book
2. Join the Rust community
3. Practice with small projects
4. Contribute to open source

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Forgetting to make variables mutable
- Fighting with the borrow checker
- Not using cargo for dependency management

## Resources for Learning

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## Conclusion

Getting started with Rust might seem challenging at first, but with proper guidance and practice, you'll be writing efficient and safe code in no time.

## What's Next

Stay tuned for the next article in this series where we'll dive into Rust's ownership system and borrowing rules.

## Core Principles

### Open Source First
I believe in the power of open source software to drive innovation and create better technology for everyone. My commitments include:

- Contributing to existing open source projects
- Releasing my own work under open source licenses
- Building upon open standards and protocols

### Privacy by Design
Privacy should never be an afterthought. In my work:

- User data protection is a fundamental requirement
- Data collection is minimal and purposeful
- Transparency about data usage is non-negotiable

## Professional Background

I architect distributed systems and write about software engineering. My work focuses on building resilient, scalable applications with Rust and modern tooling.

## Core Values

- **Open Source Advocacy**: Contributing to and maintaining open source projects
- **Continuous Learning**: Always staying updated with the latest technologies
- **Quality Code**: Writing maintainable, efficient, and well-documented code
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Teaching and mentoring other developers

## Approach to Development

I believe in taking a systematic approach to software development, focusing on:

1. Understanding the problem domain thoroughly
2. Designing scalable and maintainable solutions
3. Implementing with best practices in mind
4. Continuous testing and improvement
